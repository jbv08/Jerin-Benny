- Conducted site visits to assess project progress and provide technical support.

**Junior Automation Engineer @ Airborne Composites LTD (_November 2023 - April 2024_)**
- Contributed to the development of a fully automated composite pressing system for carbon fibre seat manufacturing, including Siemens S7-1500 PLC programming using TIA Portal and OMAC PackML standards.
- Designed and wired multiple industrial control cabinets and electrical/control circuits in compliance with BS EN standards, ensuring safety, reliability, and maintainability.
- Integrated heater controllers via RS485 using the CM PtP module, enabling Modbus RTU communication for precise thermal control.
- Configured and commissioned JVL integrated servo motors over PROFINET for conveyor automation, including motion control logic and diagnostics.
- Developed robust communication, safety, and motion control routines to ensure high reliability and efficiency across the production line

**Automation Engineer R&D @ Airborne Composites LTD (_May 2024 - Present_)**

***R&D Projects – Aerospace Automation for Composite Manufacturing***
- Robotic Cell Integration: Supported the integration of a Zund ply cutter, KUKA robot, UR10 cobot, and conveyor into a modular automated cell. Programmed Siemens S7-1500 PLCs, established PROFINET communication, and ---implemented ROS 2-based motion control for flexible and accurate ply handling.
- Smart Monitoring System: Developed a real-time monitoring system using RS485 sensors (dust, vibration, gyroscope) and integrated it with Python, ROS 2, and OPC UA. Enabled live tracking of OEE, safety metrics, and product quality using vision and weighing systems.
- APP System Development: Contributed to the development and testing of APP technology, which automates ply cutting, pick-and-place operations, and laminate welding. Supported system integration and validation for large-format preforms (up to 3.5m), enabling high-accuracy, low-waste composite layup.

***Additional Engineering Projects***
- Pneumatic Press Upgrade & Safety Integration: Upgraded a pneumatic press cell for carbon fibre seat production. Designed a safety-compliant control system using ISO 13849-1, ISO 13850, and ISO 12100. Integrated Euchner interlocks, Festo PL e-rated pneumatics, and Siemens S7-1500/ET200SP safety I/O. Managed the full upgrade, coordinating engineers and students.
- Web-Based Job Selection System: Helped build a Django-based backend for managing automation cells. Used Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, NGINX, MinIO, and uv in a GitLab monorepo. Processed real-time PLC data to automate job assignment and scheduling, with remote access via a web interface.
- Hydraulic Press Integration: Designed and implemented a control system for an Enerpac hydraulic press, including safety interlocks, E-stops, and relays. Developed electrical layouts and ensured compliance with industrial safety standards.

***Achievements***
- Contributed to Airborne’s R&D efforts under the ASCEND programme, focused on developing Automated Ply Placement (APP) systems for high-rate composite manufacturing in aerospace. These systems are now used by major aerospace manufacturers like Airbus to automate the production of dry fibre preforms for RTM structures.
